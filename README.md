# flutter_tasks

## project 3 created on 5/26/2021
This project will be kind of like a combination between the first and second project. 
It will accept a string which will be used to search for Github repos, and then list them;
and as you scroll down will, hopefully, lazy load and will get 10 repos at a time. Hopefull it works!
